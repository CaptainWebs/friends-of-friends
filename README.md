## Friendship-based Access Control System for Mongoose

This module is a work in progress, and will likely break on you because I haven't spent the time to write tests to verify updates (from me or you).

If you would like to contribute, point out errors, etc, I would be much appreciative!

This module started as a core component of [adminion/off-the-record](https://github.com/adminion/off-the-record) as an alternative to [mongoose-friends](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-friends).  The goal is to create a comprehensive Friendship-based Access Control System with a rich API to *dramatically* simplify managing Friend-Relationships.

API coming soon, but I have made pretty thorough comments (perhaps redundant in some places)
